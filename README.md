# Decoding behavior from calcium imaging data

This is the supporting code and data for the manuscript: 'A probabilistic framework for decoding behavior from in vivo calcium imaging data' by Guillaume Etter, Frederic Manseau, and Sylvain Williams

Last update on: 2020/02/28
- extract_1D_information computes MI (instead of KLD), prior and posterior probability distributions
- Added bootstrapping in fig1
- Simplified fig5: confidence intervals are sufficient to estimate encoding predicition variability

COMING SOON:
- Python notebook version
- Functional implementation
- Generalization of the code for discrete states (instead of binning continuous states in the present form)
